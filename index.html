<p>Everyone can relate being either overworked from a busy schedule or fatigued from a long work or study session.
Prioto, grandchild of Aviato, addresses both of these issues by implementing two highly regarded productivity techniques - the Eisenhower Method and Pomodoro Technique.</p>

<h3>
<a id="eisenhower-method" class="anchor" href="#eisenhower-method" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Eisenhower Method?</h3>

<p>The Eisenhower method encourages users to consider both the urgency and importance of each of their tasks, avoiding the common case of working mindlessly on time-consuming tasks regardless of their impact and not having enough time for important ones. 
Prioto implements the Eisenhower method by prompting users to choose between four different priority options for each of their tasks in a task list that is further organized by color intensity in each section. As a result, the most important and urgent tasks reside at the top to be completed first.</p>

<h3>
<a id="pomodoro-technique" class="anchor" href="#pomodoro-technique" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pomodoro Technique?</h3>

<p>The Pomodoro  technique addresses the second issue of work burnout by encouraging users to work in intervals of work and break rather than one long session of work.
Prioto implements this with a simple self-switching timer with customizable work and break intervals based on preference.</p>
