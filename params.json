As a result, the most important and urgent tasks reside at the top to be completed first.\r\n\r\n### Pomodoro Technique?\r\nThe Pomodoro  technique addresses the second issue of work burnout by encouraging users to work in intervals of work and break rather than one long session of work.\r\nPrioto implements this with a simple self-switching timer with customizable work and break intervals based on preference.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Prioto or wish to report a bug / suggest a feature?
